// OFFICE-27: Suggestion (track-changes) model.
//
// A Suggestion records a proposed insertion or deletion in a Docs document.
// It is stored as a sidecar (analogous to Comments) and never modifies the
// base document until a reviewer accepts it.
//
// SeqClock is an HLC tick for CRDT LWW-merge across peers — the same clock
// scheme used by Comments and Spaces messages.
