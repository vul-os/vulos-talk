// Package billing enforces entitlements and emits usage through the integration
// seam, applying the "no-holes" rule to office's billable actions:
//
//   - GATED:    every billable action is checked against a freshly-fetched
//     entitlement BEFORE the action (server-side, before resource issuance).
//   - METERED:  every successful billable action is reported via the Usage seam.
//   - BYPASS-PROOF: the gate runs on the server using the verified account id,
//     never a client-supplied value, and before any resource is issued.
//
// CRITICAL: enforcement must be a NO-OP in standalone mode. The standalone seam
// returns an unlimited, never-suspended entitlement, so:
//
//   - a 0/negative cap means "unlimited" → allow;
//   - Suspended is always false → never block;
//   - features["office"] is absent → office enabled.
//
// This package imports ONLY backend/seam (the interface), never the optional
// backend/integration/cloud adapter, preserving the core's independence: office
// stays self-hostable with zero cloud configuration and the cloud package can be
// deleted without breaking this enforcement layer.
